Problem Statement: The problem is the need for an accurate and timely interpretation of chest X-ray images to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating various lung diseases effectively.The primary objective of this proposed framework work is to detect and classify various lung diseases from standard X-ray images and Computerized Tomography (CT) scan images with the help of volume datasets.
Solution: Developing an AI-based chest X-ray prediction system that utilizes deep learning algorithms to analyse and interpret chest X-ray images. The system is capable of detecting and classifying abnormalities. The main contribution of this research is the development of this new Hybrid deep learning algorithm suitable for predicting lung disease from X-ray images.

This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset contains 30,805 distinct patients' 112,120 X-ray images labelled with diseases.
